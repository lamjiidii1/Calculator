## What is this?
This is a basic calculator app written in C using GTK+ for the UI. It supports simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Notes
This is personal project to improve my coding skills, similar to a college project. My main goal was to build it without using any AI or so, All codes here are wrriten by me with depencing on official GTK+ docs, so the code might have some rough edges or suboptimal solutions.
